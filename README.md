# Introduction

h Welcome

This book intends to be an introduction to Esperanto for English speakers. Esperanto is a constructed language created by L.L. Zamenhof in 1887, and has grown to become the most widely spoken constructed language in history.&#x20;

It was designed to be an auxiliary language, to be used between speakers of different primary languages. In its design it had  focus on being easy and fun to learn, as well as having very regular rules.&#x20;

### Alphabet

The Esperanto alphabet contains the following letters:

a b c ĉ d e f g ĝ h ĥ i j ĵ k l m n o p r s ŝ t u ŭ v z

They are a phonetic alphabet, so each letter has a distinct sound. Most are pronounced like their English counterparts. We will cover some of the distinctions below:

c - ts as in ca**ts**\
ĉ - ch as in **ch**air\

ĥ - ch as in the lo**ch** ness monster\
